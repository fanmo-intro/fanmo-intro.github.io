I am currently a full professor at the University of Electronics and Science Technology, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Oxford, where I lead the AI and Graph Learning Group, and a Visiting Fellow at the Department of Computer Science, University of Cambridge. My research spans knowledge graphs, graph neural networks, robotics, and machine learning, with applications in intelligent manufacturing, computational biology, and sustainable systems.

Previously, I was a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow at the Centre for Human-Inspired Artificial Intelligence, University of Cambridge. I hold a joint Ph.D. from the University of Nottingham, the University of Oxford, and KTH Royal Institute of Technology, supported by the EU Horizon 2020 programme. Over the past few years, I have led and contributed to multi-million-pound research projects, developed AI-driven systems with partners such as Siemens and ABB, and published more than 40 papers in top-tier journals and conferences.

Beyond research, I serve as Chair of the China Chapter of the Marie Curie Alumni Association, organizing international forums and academic events. I am passionate about bridging academia and industry, fostering open collaboration, and advancing AI for real-world impact.


I am currently pursuing a **Ph.D. in Computer Science** at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/). In addition to my doctoral studies, I am a **Visiting Researcher** at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/), working closely with [Professor Pietro Liò(MAE, FAAIA)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/). I am also a **Turing Enrichment Student** at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/doctoral-students/kaiwen-zuo), where I collaborate with [Professor Anthony (Tony) Cohn(FREng, FLSW, CEng, CITP, FAAAI, FEurAI, FAISB, FAAIA, FAIIA, FIET, FBCS)](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/computing/staff/76/professor-anthony-tony-g-cohn-freng-flsw-ceng-citp). Prior to my Ph.D., I completed an **MSc in Computer Science with Distinction** at [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/), and earned a **BSc** from [Beijing Jiaotong University](http://en.njtu.edu.cn/).

In addition to my doctoral research, I am the Chief Operating Officer(COO) of **Glacier Wisdom(Tsinghua‑affiliated startup)**, and an active member of **CBAIA**, **UK-CSAE**, and **CLSS-UK**. These affiliations allow me to collaborate with leading researchers across disciplines and foster strong academic networks.

My research interests lie at the intersection of:

- **AI for Healthcare**: Investigating the performance of generalist medical models, and leveraging AGI to empower healthcare.  
- **Safety-oriented AI**: Exploring the safety, trustworthiness, and reliability of general medical models, with a focus on ensuring their robustness and clinical readiness.  
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Examining the diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of large language models in clinical and biomedical contexts.  
- **Agentic Systems**: Advocating for system-level intelligence in next-generation medical AI — to address the complexity of real-world healthcare tasks and support integrated, scalable clinical workflows.  



I am particularly interested in responsible AI systems that align with human values, and in the development of interpretable models for scientific discovery and healthcare reasoning.

I am always open to collaboration with motivated **students** and **researchers**. Feel free to reach out if our interests align!
