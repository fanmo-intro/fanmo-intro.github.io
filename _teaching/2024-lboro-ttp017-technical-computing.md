**Role:** Guest Lecturer  
**Course Code:** TTP017  
**Module Title:** Technical Computing  

Delivered Lecture 5 on **Advanced Implementation** for the TTP017 Technical Computing module.  
The lecture introduced MATLAB-based optimization, model predictive control, and electric-vehicle energy management using Simulink.

**Key Topics**
- Advanced MATLAB functions and toolboxes: Optimization, Control, Signal Processing, Robotics Systems.  
- Model Predictive Control (MPC) — design, simulation, and stability analysis.  
- MATLAB + Simulink for electric-vehicle applications: energy-flow modeling, drive-cycle optimization, and regenerative braking strategy.  
- Example implementation of **optimal control** for EV energy management using `fmincon` and Genetic Algorithm.  

**Outcomes**
- Demonstrated a MATLAB optimization reducing energy consumption from 15.2 kWh to 12.8 kWh (≈ 15.8 % improvement).  
- Students practiced implementing and visualizing results in MATLAB and Simulink.
