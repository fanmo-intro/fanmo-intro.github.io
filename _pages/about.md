# About Me / 关于我

I am a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow and researcher at the Centre for Human-Inspired Artificial Intelligence, University of Cambridge, where I also hold a postdoctoral affiliation with Trinity College.  My research spans **knowledge graphs, graph neural networks, robotics, and machine learning**, with applications in **intelligent manufacturing, computational biology, and sustainable systems**.  
我现为剑桥大学“人工智能研究中心”的**玛丽·居里学者**，并隶属于剑桥**三一学院**从事博士后研究工作。我的研究聚焦于**知识图谱、图神经网络、机器人技术与机器学习**，致力于推动其在**智能制造、计算生物学与可持续系统**等领域的应用。  

I hold a joint Ph.D. from the University of Nottingham, the University of Oxford, and KTH Royal Institute of Technology, supported by the **EU Horizon 2020** programme. Over the past few years, I have led and contributed to multi-million-pound research projects, developed AI-driven systems with partners like **Siemens** and **ABB**, and published more than **40 papers** in top journals and conferences.  
我拥有诺丁汉大学、牛津大学与瑞典皇家理工学院联合授予的博士学位，期间获得**欧盟地平线2020项目**资助。近年来，我主持和参与多个总额达数百万英镑的国际科研项目，与**西门子、ABB**等企业联合开发AI系统，发表学术论文**40余篇**，其中多篇发表于国际顶级期刊与会议。  

Beyond research, I serve as **Chair of the China Chapter of the Marie Curie Alumni Association**, where I organize international forums and academic events.  I am passionate about **bridging academia and industry**, promoting **open collaboration**, and applying **AI to real-world challenges**.  
除科研工作外，我还担任**“玛丽·居里学者协会中国分会”主席**，积极组织国际论坛与学术活动。我热衷于推动**产学研融合**、促进**中欧科研交流**，并致力于将人工智能应用于**实际问题解决**之中。
