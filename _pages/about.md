Welcome!
======

I am **Fan Mo**, a researcher in **AI, robotics, and sustainability**.  
Currently, I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge**, working on applying artificial intelligence to improve **environmental performance and sustainability in manufacturing and supply chains**.  

I obtained my **Ph.D. in Intelligent Robotics and Machine Vision** from **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**, where I worked on reconfigurable robotic assembly systems. I have also held research positions at **Oxford**, **Nottingham**, **ETH Z√ºrich**, and **UC Berkeley**, focusing on **knowledge graphs, reinforcement learning, embodied intelligence, and multimodal perception**.  

My research interests include:
- ü§ñ **Embodied AI & Robotics**: reconfigurable robotic assembly, task & motion planning  
- üåç **AI for Sustainability**: lifecycle assessment (LCA), knowledge graphs, multimodal analytics  
- üß† **Machine Learning**: graph neural networks (GNNs), reinforcement learning (RL), multimodal fusion  
- üë• **Collaboration & Leadership**: Vice Chair of the Marie Curie Alumni Association (China Chapter), Associate Editor (RAL, ICRA, IROS)  

I have published more than **30 papers** in journals and top conferences, and my work has been recognized with several awards, including the **Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellowship**, the **DAAD Fellowship**, and the **Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award** at SJTU.  

You can find more details in my [CV](/cv/) and explore my [publications](/publications/), [talks](/talks/), and [projects](/portfolio/).
