abstract: >
    This paper investigates capacity modeling and measurement methodologies for smart elastic manufacturing systems. The proposed approach characterizes system capacity under dynamic operating conditions, enabling quantitative assessment of elasticity and responsiveness in smart manufacturing environments. By integrating modeling techniques with performance measurement indicators, the framework supports informed decision-making for capacity planning and adaptive manufacturing system design. Results presented at the SAE AeroTech Conference demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methods to aerospace-oriented manufacturing scenarios.
