    This paper addresses the role of instructional design in supporting learners with disabilities in higher education contexts. The study examines inclusive design principles and adaptive learning methodologies that enhance accessibility and engagement in online and blended learning environments. By aligning instructional strategies with diverse learner needs, the proposed approach contributes to more equitable and effective educational practices. The findings highlight practical guidelines for designing learning experiences that accommodate disability-related requirements in higher education.
