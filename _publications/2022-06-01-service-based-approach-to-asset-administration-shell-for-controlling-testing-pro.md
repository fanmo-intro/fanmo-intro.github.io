abstract: >
  The increasing demand for personalized products and cost-effectiveness in manufacturing highlights the need for intelligent control of production processes. This paper presents a service-based approach that leverages the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) framework to control and manage testing processes in manufacturing systems. By enriching the AAS with modular artificial intelligence and service-oriented capabilities, the proposed solution improves adaptability, modularity, and scalability of testing functionality control, enabling seamless interaction between digital assets and services. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through a practical industrial use case involving leak testing, illustrating how the modular AAS architecture can streamline testing operations and foster intelligent process execution within an Industry 4.0 environment. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
