abstract: >
    This paper presents a cloud-based decision-making framework for multi-agent production systems. The proposed approach leverages cloud computing to coordinate distributed intelligent agents responsible for planning, control, and optimisation in manufacturing environments. By enabling scalable information sharing and collaborative reasoning among agents, the framework enhances system flexibility, responsiveness, and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed cloud-based architecture in supporting intelligent decision-making for complex multi-agent production systems.
