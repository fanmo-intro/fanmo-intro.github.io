abstract: >
    This paper investigates the role of semantic models and knowledge graphs as key enablers for manufacturing system reconfiguration. The proposed approach formalizes system components, capabilities, and constraints using semantic representations, enabling machine-interpretable reasoning over reconfiguration strategies. By integrating knowledge graphs with manufacturing system models, the framework supports dynamic adaptation, interoperability, and decision-making in complex production environments. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed methodology enhances reconfiguration efficiency, flexibility, and semantic consistency in manufacturing systems.
