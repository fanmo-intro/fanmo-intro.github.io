abstract: >
    This paper explores how semantic models and knowledge graphs can serve as key enablers for manufacturing system reconfiguration. The proposed approach represents system components, capabilities, and constraints using formal semantic models, enabling structured reasoning and interoperability across heterogeneous manufacturing assets. By integrating knowledge graphs with operational models, the framework supports dynamic reconfiguration, decision-making, and adaptability in complex production environments. Experimental case studies demonstrate that the proposed method improves reconfiguration efficiency, flexibility, and semantic consistency in manufacturing systems.
