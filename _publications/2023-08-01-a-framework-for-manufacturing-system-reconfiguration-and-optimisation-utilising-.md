abstract: >
    This paper presents a comprehensive framework for manufacturing system reconfiguration and optimisation that integrates digital twin technologies with modular artificial intelligence. The proposed approach combines virtual system representations with intelligent decision-making modules to enable adaptive reconfiguration, performance optimisation, and scenario analysis in complex manufacturing environments. By leveraging digital twins for real-time system monitoring and modular AI components for reasoning and optimisation, the framework enhances flexibility, scalability, and responsiveness in manufacturing systems. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in supporting intelligent reconfiguration and optimisation across diverse production scenarios.
