    This paper proposes a multi-phase scheduling method for reconfigurable flexible job-shops with multi-machine cooperation based on a scout and mutation-based Aquila optimiser. The proposed approach decomposes the scheduling problem into multiple coordinated phases to address reconfigurability, machine cooperation, and operational constraints simultaneously. By integrating an enhanced Aquila optimisation strategy with scouting and mutation mechanisms, the method improves solution quality, convergence speed, and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling framework in reducing makespan and improving system performance in complex reconfigurable manufacturing environments.
