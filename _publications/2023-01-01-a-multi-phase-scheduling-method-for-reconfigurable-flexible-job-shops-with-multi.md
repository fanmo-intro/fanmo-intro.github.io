abstract: >
  Reconfigurable flexible job-shops (RFJSs) require advanced scheduling strategies that can simultaneously handle reconfiguration alongside production tasks and multi-machine cooperation. This paper proposes a novel multi-phase scheduling method to address the reconfiguration scheduling problem with cooperation among multiple machines. A mathematical model is formulated for the problem considering both reconfiguration costs and maximum completion time as key optimisation objectives. To effectively solve the model, two manufacturing resource adjustment strategies are introduced along with a three-layer coding method. A Scout and Mutation-based Aquila Optimiser (SMAO) is developed with four improvement strategies to balance exploration and exploitation and accelerate convergence. The performance of the proposed approach is verified through experiments on standard test functions and real-world scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing makespan and improving scheduling quality compared to conventional methods. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
