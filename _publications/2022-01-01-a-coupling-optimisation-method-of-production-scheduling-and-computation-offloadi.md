abstract: >
    This paper proposes a coupling optimisation method that jointly considers production scheduling and computation offloading for intelligent workshops with a cloud–edge–terminal architecture. The proposed approach integrates manufacturing task scheduling with computational resource allocation to minimise production makespan and computation latency simultaneously. By modelling the interactions between physical production processes and distributed computing resources, the method provides coordinated optimisation strategies for intelligent manufacturing systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves production efficiency while reducing computation delay in cloud–edge–terminal environments.
