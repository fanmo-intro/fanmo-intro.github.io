abstract: >
    This chapter investigates the integration of cutting-edge interoperability approaches in cyber-physical production systems within the context of Industry 4.0. The work analyzes emerging standards, architectural patterns, and communication mechanisms that enable seamless interaction among heterogeneous cyber-physical components. By examining interoperability challenges across system layers, the chapter highlights strategies for improving integration, scalability, and adaptability in modern production systems. The findings provide practical insights for the design and maintenance of interoperable cyber-physical production environments.
