abstract: >  
    Hallucination in medical large language models (LLMs) poses a significant risk to safety and reliability in AI-powered clinical applications. We introduce MedHallBench — a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate hallucination behaviours in medical-domain LLMs. MedHallBench covers multiple clinical scenarios, including diagnosis, patient communication, and treatment recommendation, and comprises a curated set of case-based prompts with expert-verified ground truth. We evaluate leading medical LLMs using MedHallBench, revealing common failure modes and substantial gaps in factual accuracy and consistency, highlighting the urgent need for improved hallucination mitigation in medical LLM deployment.
