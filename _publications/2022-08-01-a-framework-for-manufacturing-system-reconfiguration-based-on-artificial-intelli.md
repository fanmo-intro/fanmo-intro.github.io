  This paper proposes a framework that integrates digital twins and artificial intelligence to enable dynamic reconfiguration of manufacturing systems in response to varying customer and market demands. Traditional digital twin approaches are typically applied to single static processes; the proposed framework extends this by applying digital twins to system-level reconfiguration including layout, process parameters, and operation times across multiple assets. A digital twin environment is developed to simulate a manufacturing process with multiple industrial robots, and a data pipeline with an API enables integration of AI methods to optimise decision-making and reconfiguration. A multi-agent program facilitates communication and negotiation between agents to determine optimal system configurations. Compared with previous work, this framework combines distributed intelligence, AI-driven optimisation, and production line control to enhance responsiveness and adaptability in modern manufacturing systems. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
