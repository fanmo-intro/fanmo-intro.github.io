    This paper presents a framework for manufacturing system reconfiguration that integrates artificial intelligence techniques with digital twin technology. The proposed framework combines intelligent decision-making with virtual system representations to support adaptive reconfiguration, performance evaluation, and what-if analysis in complex manufacturing environments. By leveraging AI-driven reasoning and digital twins for real-time system monitoring, the approach enhances flexibility, scalability, and responsiveness in manufacturing system reconfiguration. Results presented at FAIM 2022 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in supporting intelligent and adaptive manufacturing systems.
