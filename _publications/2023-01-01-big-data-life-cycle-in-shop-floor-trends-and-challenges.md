abstract: >
  Big data in the manufacturing shop-floor comprises large structured and unstructured datasets collected across every stage of production, including machine, sensor, and operator-level information. This article presents a **comprehensive narrative literature review** of the big data life cycle on the shop-floor, covering data sources, collection, transmission, storage, processing, and visualization stages. It synthesizes current **technological trends** and **methodological approaches** used to leverage big data for performance improvement and optimization in intelligent manufacturing. The review is structured around two research questions and uses n-gram analysis to characterize key themes and challenge areas. The article also discusses key **challenges**, such as data heterogeneity and integration, and outlines **future research directions** toward effective big data utilization in shop-floor contexts. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
