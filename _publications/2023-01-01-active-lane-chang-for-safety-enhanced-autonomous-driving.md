  This paper proposes an active lane change algorithm targeted at improving safety in autonomous driving by addressing risks arising from surrounding traffic and dynamic road conditions. By incorporating **safety-critical model predictive control (MPC)** constraints into the lane change planning process, the method actively responds to mandated lane change requirements while maintaining safe distances from other vehicles. The algorithm evaluates environmental conditions and predicts potential conflict scenarios, enabling autonomous vehicles to negotiate mandatory lane changes with enhanced caution and reduced collision risk. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields safer and more reliable lane change behaviors in varied driving environments compared to conventional methods. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
