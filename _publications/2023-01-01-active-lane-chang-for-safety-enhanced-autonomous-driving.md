abstract: >
    This paper investigates an active lane change strategy for safety-enhanced autonomous driving. The proposed approach integrates perception and decision-making modules to enable autonomous vehicles to perform proactive and safe lane changes under dynamic traffic conditions. By considering surrounding vehicle behavior and safety constraints, the method improves collision avoidance capability and driving safety. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in enhancing autonomous driving performance in complex traffic scenarios.
