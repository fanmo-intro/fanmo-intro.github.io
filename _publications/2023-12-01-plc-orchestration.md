abstract: >
    This paper presents a PLC orchestration automation framework to enhance human–machine integration in adaptive manufacturing systems. The proposed approach coordinates programmable logic controllers and higher-level control logic to enable flexible task allocation, adaptive system behavior, and improved collaboration between human operators and automated components. By integrating orchestration mechanisms with manufacturing execution and control layers, the framework supports dynamic adaptation to changing production requirements. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves system responsiveness, robustness, and overall operational efficiency in adaptive manufacturing environments.
