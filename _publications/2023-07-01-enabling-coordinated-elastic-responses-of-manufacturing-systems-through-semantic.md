abstract: >
    This paper proposes a semantic modelling approach to enable coordinated elastic responses in manufacturing systems. By formalizing system capabilities, constraints, and operational contexts using semantic representations, the proposed method supports adaptive coordination and elasticity across heterogeneous manufacturing resources. The framework enables manufacturing systems to respond coherently to disturbances, demand fluctuations, and reconfiguration requirements. Results presented at the IFAC World Congress demonstrate the effectiveness of semantic modelling in improving system-level responsiveness and coordination in complex manufacturing environments.
