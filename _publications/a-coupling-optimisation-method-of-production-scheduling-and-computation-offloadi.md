  This paper proposes a novel Production scheduling-Computation offloading Coupling Optimization (PCCO) model tailored for intelligent workshops with a cloud-edge-terminal (CET) architecture, aiming to jointly optimize the production job completion time and computing task offloading delay. The proposed model formulates dual objectives — minimizing makespan of production tasks and reducing overall offloading latency — under the constraints of workshop resource availability and heterogeneous computing capabilities. To solve this multi-objective optimisation problem, an integrated optimization approach is developed that considers manufacturing scheduling and computation offloading decisions simultaneously, accounting for the interplay between physical production processes and computation tasks in the CET environment. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the method effectively balances production efficiency with computation delay, providing insights into coordinated scheduling strategies for next-generation smart manufacturing systems. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
