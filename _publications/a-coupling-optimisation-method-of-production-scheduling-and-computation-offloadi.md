    This paper proposes a novel production scheduling–computation offloading coupling optimisation (PCCO) model tailored for intelligent workshops with a cloud-edge-terminal (CET) architecture, aiming to jointly optimise production job completion time and computing task offloading delay. The proposed model formulates dual objectives—minimising the makespan of production tasks and reducing overall offloading latency—under constraints related to workshop resource availability and heterogeneous computing capabilities. An integrated optimisation approach is developed to simultaneously consider manufacturing scheduling and computation offloading decisions, explicitly modelling the interaction between physical production processes and computational tasks in a CET environment. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively balances production efficiency and computation delay, providing coordinated scheduling strategies for next-generation smart manufacturing systems.
