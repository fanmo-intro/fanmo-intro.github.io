abstract: >
    The coexistence of manual and autonomous driving leads to nonstandard final parking states (FPS) of adjacent vehicles, which can hinder passenger door access if a standard FPS is enforced for the target vehicle. To enhance passenger comfort during boarding and alighting, this paper proposes an efficient bidirectional search hybrid A* (BHA*) method for parking path planning under adjacent vehicle deviation scenarios. A characterization variable for passenger comfort is constructed based on allowable and required door opening angles under adjacent vehicle constraints. An optimization model for the FPS is established with a comprehensive objective that balances passenger comfort for both target and adjacent vehicles while ensuring safe distances. A genetic algorithm is employed to determine the optimal FPS, and Voronoi potential fields combined with a bidirectional search strategy are used to generate feasible and comfortable parking paths. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BHA* method effectively improves parking feasibility and passenger comfort in complex parking environments.
