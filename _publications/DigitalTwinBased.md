abstract: >
    Industry 4.0 demands intelligent and autonomous manufacturing systems that can adapt to dynamic and uncertain environments. A key enabler of such systems is self-learning, which supports effective decision-making under uncertainty. However, conventional approaches typically rely on large volumes of physical production data, limiting their applicability during early deployment phases. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a digital twin-based self-learning decision-making framework that enables virtual training and validation of decision models prior to physical deployment. The framework comprises four modular components: a digital twin for simulating the production environment, a learning module for generating and evaluating decisions, a real controller for executing validated actions, and the physical production system. A time-delayed deployment mechanism is introduced to ensure the safe transfer of learned behaviors from the virtual environment to real-world operation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework enhances decision quality, adaptability, and deployment efficiency for industrial robotic systems.
