    This paper investigates the use of large language models to advance capability matching in manufacturing system reconfiguration. The proposed approach leverages LLMs to interpret heterogeneous capability descriptions, align system requirements with available resources, and support intelligent reconfiguration decisions. By integrating language-based reasoning with manufacturing knowledge representations, the framework enhances flexibility, scalability, and robustness in complex manufacturing environments. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving reconfiguration accuracy and decision efficiency.
