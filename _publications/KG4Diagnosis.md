    Integrating large language models (LLMs) into healthcare diagnosis demands systematic frameworks capable of handling complex medical scenarios while preserving domain-specific expertise. Here we propose KG4Diagnosis — a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates LLMs with automated medical knowledge graph construction, covering 362 common diseases across specialties. The system mirrors real-world clinical workflows via a two-tier architecture: a general-practitioner agent conducts initial assessment and triage, then delegates to specialized agents for in-depth diagnosis in specific domains. Our core innovation lies in an end-to-end knowledge graph generation pipeline, which combines semantic-driven entity and relation extraction, multi-dimensional decision-relationship reconstruction from unstructured medical texts, and human-guided reasoning for knowledge expansion. KG4Diagnosis establishes an extensible, modular foundation for accurate and scalable AI-powered medical diagnosis systems.
