  Carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminates are widely used in aerospace and other high-performance applications, yet they are susceptible to internal defects that can compromise structural integrity. This paper proposes a novel approach to locate internal defects by analyzing vibration signals using a Global Interactive Attention-based Lightweight Denoising Network (GIALDN). The method begins with a tailored signal acquisition scheme and applies threshold denoising to remove noise and enhance feature discrimination. A global interactive attention module enables the network to focus on informative features and capture rich contextual relationships, while a de-pooling convolution strategy with residual connections forms the backbone of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that GIALDN achieves a defect location accuracy of 98.68%, outperforming classical CNN, LSTM, and other deep learning baselines, and exhibits strong adaptability across CFRP laminates with varied stacking sequences. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
