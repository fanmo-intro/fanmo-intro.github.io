    This paper proposes a global interactive attention-based lightweight denoising network for accurately locating internal defects in CFRP laminates. The proposed method integrates global contextual feature extraction with interactive attention mechanisms to enhance defect-related representations while maintaining a lightweight network structure. By effectively suppressing noise and highlighting defect features, the network achieves improved localization accuracy under limited computational resources. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in defect detection performance, making it suitable for real-time and industrial nondestructive testing applications.
