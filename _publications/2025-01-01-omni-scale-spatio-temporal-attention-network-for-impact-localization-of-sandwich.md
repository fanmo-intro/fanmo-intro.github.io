    This paper proposes an omni-scale spatio-temporal attention network for accurate impact localization in sandwich composite panels. The proposed network captures spatio-temporal features across multiple scales to effectively model the complex wave propagation patterns induced by impact events. By integrating attention mechanisms at different temporal and spatial resolutions, the method enhances sensitivity to impact-related signatures while suppressing noise and irrelevant variations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior localization accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods, making it suitable for structural health monitoring of composite sandwich structures.
