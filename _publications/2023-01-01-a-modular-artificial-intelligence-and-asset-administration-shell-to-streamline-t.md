abstract: >
    This paper proposes a modular artificial intelligence framework integrated with the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) to streamline testing processes in manufacturing services. The approach combines modular AI components with standardized asset representations to support interoperability, automation, and scalability in testing workflows. By embedding intelligence within the AAS structure, the framework enables efficient orchestration of testing activities, improved data consistency, and enhanced decision support. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution in reducing testing effort and improving service efficiency in manufacturing environments.
