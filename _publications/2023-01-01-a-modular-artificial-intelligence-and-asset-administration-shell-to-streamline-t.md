abstract: >
  The increasing demand for personalized products and cost-effectiveness has highlighted the necessity of integrating intelligence into production systems. This integration is crucial for enabling adaptive, intelligent control that enhances functionality while reducing costs. This research proposes a novel method for controlling testing functionality in manufacturing systems using an Asset Administration Shell (AAS) enriched with modular artificial intelligence. The architecture not only effectively controls execution behavior through service-based mechanisms but also offers modularity that enhances adaptability and scalability. Different machine learning models can be substituted to meet diverse requirements, enabling more efficient and cost-effective solutions. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated using a practical leak-testing use case, highlighting the benefits of the modular design in real-world manufacturing environments. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
