    This paper proposes a variational Bayesian learning framework with a reliable likelihood approximation for accurate process quality evaluation. The proposed method addresses uncertainty modelling and inference challenges in complex industrial processes by introducing a robust approximation strategy for likelihood estimation. By integrating variational inference with reliable probabilistic modelling, the approach improves prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification in process quality assessment. Experimental results on industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing evaluation reliability and decision support for industrial informatics applications.
