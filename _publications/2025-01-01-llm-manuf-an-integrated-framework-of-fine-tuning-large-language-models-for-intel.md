    This paper presents LLM-MANUF, an integrated framework for fine-tuning large language models to support intelligent decision-making in manufacturing systems. The proposed framework adapts general-purpose LLMs to manufacturing-specific tasks through domain-aware data curation, task-oriented fine-tuning strategies, and structured knowledge integration. By aligning language model reasoning with manufacturing process semantics, LLM-MANUF enables effective decision support across planning, scheduling, and operational optimization scenarios. Experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves decision accuracy, robustness, and adaptability in complex manufacturing environments.
