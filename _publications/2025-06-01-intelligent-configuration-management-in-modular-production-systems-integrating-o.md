abstract: >
    This paper investigates intelligent configuration management for modular production systems by integrating operational semantics with knowledge graph representations. The proposed approach formalizes configuration knowledge and system behavior through operational semantics, enabling consistent reasoning across modular components. A knowledge graph is constructed to capture configuration rules, dependencies, and operational constraints, supporting dynamic reconfiguration and decision-making in complex manufacturing environments. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed framework improves configuration efficiency, adaptability, and semantic consistency in modular production systems.
