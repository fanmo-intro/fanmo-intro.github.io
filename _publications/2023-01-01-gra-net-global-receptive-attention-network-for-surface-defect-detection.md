    This paper proposes GRA-Net, a global receptive attention network for surface defect detection in industrial inspection scenarios. The proposed network enlarges the effective receptive field through global attention mechanisms, enabling robust feature extraction for defect regions of varying scales and appearances. By integrating global contextual information with discriminative local features, GRA-Net improves detection accuracy and robustness under complex surface conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on benchmark surface defect datasets, confirming its effectiveness for intelligent quality inspection applications.
