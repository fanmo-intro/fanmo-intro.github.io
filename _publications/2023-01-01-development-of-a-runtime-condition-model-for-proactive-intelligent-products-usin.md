abstract: >
    This paper proposes a runtime-condition modelling approach for proactive intelligent products by integrating knowledge graphs with embedding techniques. The proposed model captures dynamic operational conditions and contextual knowledge to enable intelligent products to anticipate system states and support proactive decision-making. By combining symbolic knowledge representations with continuous embedding spaces, the framework enhances adaptability, scalability, and reasoning capability in intelligent product systems. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in improving responsiveness and intelligence in knowledge-driven product lifecycle management.
