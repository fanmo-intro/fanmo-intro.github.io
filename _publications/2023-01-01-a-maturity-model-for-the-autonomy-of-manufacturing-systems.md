abstract: >
    This paper proposes a maturity model to characterize and assess the autonomy of manufacturing systems. The model defines structured autonomy levels by considering system intelligence, decision-making capability, adaptability, and human–machine collaboration. By providing a systematic framework for evaluating autonomy progression, the proposed maturity model supports benchmarking, strategic planning, and the design of next-generation autonomous manufacturing systems. Case studies and expert evaluations demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of the model in industrial contexts.
