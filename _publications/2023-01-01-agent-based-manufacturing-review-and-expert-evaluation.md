abstract: >
  The advent of smart manufacturing and exposure to a new generation of technological enablers have transformed traditional manufacturing processes into highly connected, integrated, and intelligent systems. This article reviews the state of the art in agent-based manufacturing, focusing on how **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)** can be leveraged to meet the requirements of smart manufacturing and **Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS)**. MAS are characterized by high distribution, autonomous behaviour, and flexibility, making them promising for complex manufacturing environments. The review synthesizes a broad range of research applications to clarify current trends, strengths, and limitations of agent technologies in manufacturing. A SWOT analysis is developed to identify advantages and challenges of deploying MAS in industry, and this analysis is validated through industrial expert evaluation. Key findings highlight that while agent-based solutions offer strong potential for autonomy and flexibility, further research is needed for wide industrial adoption. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
