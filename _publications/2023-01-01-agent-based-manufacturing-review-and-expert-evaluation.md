abstract: >
    This paper presents a comprehensive review and expert evaluation of agent-based manufacturing systems. The study analyzes the evolution of agent-based approaches in manufacturing, covering system architectures, coordination mechanisms, decision-making strategies, and industrial applications. By synthesizing insights from both academic literature and expert assessments, the paper identifies key challenges, performance considerations, and future research directions for deploying agent-based manufacturing systems in complex industrial environments.
