    This paper investigates human-centered artificial intelligence technologies for human–robot interaction in social settings. The proposed approaches emphasize user-centric design principles to enhance interaction naturalness, adaptability, and social acceptance of robotic systems. By integrating perception, learning, and interaction strategies, the study demonstrates how AI-driven methods can improve engagement and usability in socially interactive environments. Experimental evaluations highlight the potential of human-centered AI to support more effective and socially aware human–robot interaction.
