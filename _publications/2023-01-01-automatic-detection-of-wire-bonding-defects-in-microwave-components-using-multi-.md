    This paper presents an automatic defect detection approach for wire bonding in microwave components using multi-stage hybrid methods based on deep learning. The proposed framework combines multiple processing stages to progressively enhance defect-related features while suppressing noise and irrelevant variations. By integrating deep learning models with hybrid detection strategies, the method improves robustness and accuracy in identifying wire bonding defects under complex inspection conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for quality assurance in microwave component manufacturing.
