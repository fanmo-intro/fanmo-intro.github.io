  Wire bonding is a critical assembly process in microelectronics where the quality of the bond directly influences the performance and reliability of microwave components. This study proposes a multi-stage hybrid deep learning approach to automatically detect wire bonding defects from imaging data, integrating feature extraction, classification, and refinement stages to improve detection accuracy under variable component geometries and noise. A hybrid network combines convolutional feature learning with attention mechanisms to focus on informative signal regions and reduce false positives, while multi-stage refinement enhances segmentation precision for subtle defect patterns. Experimental results on a dataset of microwave component images demonstrate that the proposed method substantially improves defect detection performance compared to conventional image processing and single-stage networks, indicating its potential for robust automated inspection in manufacturing environments. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
