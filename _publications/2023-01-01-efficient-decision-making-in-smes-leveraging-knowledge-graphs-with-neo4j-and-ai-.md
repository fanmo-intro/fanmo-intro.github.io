abstract: >
    This paper explores efficient decision-making approaches for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by leveraging knowledge graphs implemented with Neo4j and AI-based vision technologies. The proposed framework integrates structured relational knowledge with visual perception to support data-driven operational decisions in industrial environments. By combining graph-based reasoning with AI vision, the approach enhances situational awareness, scalability, and decision accuracy for SMEs adopting low-cost digital automation solutions. Experimental results presented at LoDiSA 2023 demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.
